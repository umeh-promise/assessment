## 🚀 Task: Build a Multi-Step Onboarding Modal

Build a modal component that guides a user through a **3-step onboarding process** using tabbed navigation.

### 🧱 Requirements

The modal should contain three steps, each as a separate tab:

#### Step 1: Personal Info
- Full Name (text input)
- Email Address (email input)

#### Step 2: Account Setup
- Username (text input)
- Password (password input)

#### Step 3: Preferences
- Theme selection (dropdown: `Light` or `Dark`)
- Subscribe to newsletter? (checkbox)

### 🔄 Navigation
- Show steps visually using tabs at the top or side (Step 1, 2, 3).
- Users can navigate using **Next**, **Back**, and **Submit** buttons.
- Each step should be a **separate React component**.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- React (with Hooks)
- Tailwind CSS
- No external UI libraries (no Material UI, Bootstrap, etc.)

---

### ✨ Bonus Points

- Step-by-step validation (don’t allow user to proceed until current step is valid)

- Clean, responsive UI
